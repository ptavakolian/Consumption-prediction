# Consumption-prediction


This project predicts Fuel consumption in different engins from 300 features. First, I limited the predictive parameters to 12 by finding the most effective ones using cross-correlation results and Random forest feature importance. Then, I used different models and chose bagging that provides the best accuracy to predict the testing data

Predicting consumption using part build and performance parameters is the goal here. 
Finding the most effective parameters on consumption is the second goal in this project
You can find the code here: https://github.com/ptavakolian/Consumption-prediction/blob/master/Code_predicting%20consumption.ipynb

# All the procedure is explained in the code.


## Report

Usng cross-correlation and Random Forest Feature importance we can specify the important variables. Then, we can apply machine learning models to predict consumption with high accuracy.
