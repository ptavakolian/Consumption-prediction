# Consumption-prediction
In this project we want to estimate an output based on more than 300 parameters. 
Predicting consumption using part build and performance parameters is the goal here. 
Finding the most effective parameters on consumption is the second goal in this project
You can find the code here: https://github.com/ptavakolian/Consumption-prediction/blob/master/Code_predicting%20consumption.ipynb
